# GDP Return - Autonomous Vehicle Dynamics and Control Project

Welcome to the GDP Return project, a collaboration between Cranfield University and Airbus, by Autonomous Vehicle Dynamics and Control students.

## Main Aim:
The primary goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive test bed for evaluating Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) sensors, actuators, architectures, and algorithms. The ultimate aim is to enable vertical take-off and landing capabilities for launchers.

## Objectives:
1. **Precision Landing:** Achieve pinpoint landing accuracy in pre-selected or dynamically changing target areas, both with and without the aid of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS).
  
2. **Prototype Development:** Utilize Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components to create a dynamically equivalent test platform. This platform will simulate the functionality of common vertical take-off and landing launching systems, providing a reliable environment for testing and validation.

By addressing these objectives, the GDP Return project aims to contribute significantly to the advancement of autonomous vehicle dynamics and control, particularly in the context of vertical take-off and landing operations for aerospace applications.

## Requirements

In order to meet the objectives of the project, the prototype must adhere to specific requirements outlined below:

1. **Similarity to Existing Rockets:**
   - Maintain a comparable Thrust-to-Weight Ratio (TWR) as existing rockets. [Reference: [1]]
   - Ensure the Center of Gravity (CG) to Center of Thrust (CT) distance matches existing standards. [Reference: [2]]
   - Follow the proportions of standard landing pads to facilitate compatibility.

2. **Controllability:**
   - The prototype must demonstrate full controllability throughout all phases of operation.

3. **Performance Constraints:**
   - Structure Mass Limit: Not to exceed 4.5 kilograms.
   - Payload Mass: Accommodate a payload of up to 0.8 kilograms.

4. **Safety and Reusability:**
   - Prioritize safety measures to ensure the prototype's safe operation.
   - Design the prototype for reusability, enabling multiple test iterations.

5. **Budget Limitation:**
   - The total budget allocated for the prototype development shall not exceed Â£2,000.

Adhering to these requirements will ensure that the prototype effectively fulfills its role as a test bed for evaluating GNC sensors and actuators, architectures, and algorithms for vertical take-off and landing capabilities.
